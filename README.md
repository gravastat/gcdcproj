# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The goal is to prepare tidy data from a wearable computing study that involved collecing data from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is availabe at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data from that study can be found at:

One should create a single R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
